# Daily CSS Fun

Daily CSS Fun was a project I ran in February of 2002 with the goal of exploring the web development idea of separation of presentation of content by drastically redesigning a web page each day of the month by only changing the linked CSS document. This project was a precursor to the quite popular CSS Zen Garden organized by Dave Shea.
